My name is andre Vasquez a full-stack developer. 
I found my passion for programming when I wrote my first macro in excel VBA. the realization that I could create anything I set my mind to drove it home for me. After coding for a bit with VBA I decided I didn't want to be limited to just using excel to create; quickly scouring the internet for languages I could learn. This lead me to find the one language to rule them all "Python". After 6 months of learning python, I decided to round out my learning. Enrolling into "Nucamp Bootcamp" and diving into front-end development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and finally, React.

Ive been programming for almost two years now and although i enjoy front end development. My true passion lies in backend development.
