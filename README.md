My name is andre Vasquez a full-stack developer.(ive been working proffesionally using other companies github,bitbucket, and azure devops accounts. so my github is a little bare atm)
I found my passion for programming when I wrote my first macro in excel VBA. the realization that I could create anything I set my mind to drove it home for me. After coding for a bit with VBA I decided I didn't want to be limited to just using excel to create; quickly scouring the internet for languages I could learn. This lead me to find the one language to rule them all "Python". 
Yeah that was a lie cause i totally love Go more now, but still have a special place in my heart for python.

Ive been programming for about four years now and although i enjoy front end development. My true passion lies in Full stack development. 
Ive had the opportunity to work with some really great fortune 500 companies, and also impactful startups. some of these include
Stanley black and decker, Sally beauty, and connectRN.
